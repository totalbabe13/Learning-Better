 LISTS:

 ● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

<ol>

  <li>THIS IS A LIST ITEM TAG</li>

      minutes until tender</li>
  <li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
  <li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>

</ol>

● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

definitions for each of those terms.
